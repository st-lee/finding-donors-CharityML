    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "- SVC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)\n",
    " 1. Application: categorize unlabeled data, and is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in industrial applications.\n",
    " 2. Upside: SVM could solve high dimension and non-linear problems.\n",
    " 3. Downside: Usually support in classifying two categories if you got many things to be classified, choose another algorithm, otherwise it will take ages to run. Plus, it would be very time consuming when the dataset is mass.\n",
    " 4. Because SVM works well with a clear margin of separation, and we just want to classify two categories (<=50k & >50k), therefore SVM might be a good model to use in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- AdaBoost (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost)\n",
    " 1. Application: Viola & Jones’ Face Detector\n",
    " 2. Upside: It is fast and robust, which can be run in real-time.\n",
    " 3. Downside: It taks a long time to train the model and require a lot of training sample.\n",
    " 4. AdaBoost could be used in any classifying task, which adopts \"weak learners\" to largely improve the performance, might be a good choice in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- DecisionTree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)\n",
    " 1. Application: Detect potential diabetes patients\n",
    " 2. Upside: Decision tree can be used in numerical and categorical features\n",
    " 3. Downside: It is more likely to overfitting than other algorithms.\n",
    " 4. Decision tree is the easiest model to understand because it is similar to human decision-making process. Also, it can work with a big range of tasks. Hence, I usually use it and RandomForest during my jobs."

    "I'd choose the \"AdaBoostClassifier\" as my best model to use for this dataset. Firstly, AdaBoost is doing well because the F-score is comparable in its training and validation set. We can see the Decision Tree is a bit overfitting. Also, the accuracy and F-score is highest in AdaBoost when 100% of the validation set is used. Secondly, the training and validation time is not too long when we use AdaBoost. We don't choose SVC because it takes ages to fit this database but doesn't provide good F-score. Finally, AdaBoost is good at dealing with a dataset which is not too skew and noisy. As we have already cleaned and normalized this dataset, I believe AdaBoost is suitable for this task."

    "Once upon a time, Snow White was trapped by a devil, and seven dwarfs were running to rescue her.\n",
    "\n",
    "The devil said, \"you have to pass this trick, otherwise I won't let you and the princess go!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The devil split blue and red balls randomly. Grumpy put a twig in between those balls but he realised that he didn't successfully separate them, he got angry and wanted to give up. And then, Bashful gave another try but still failed, he blushed instantly. And then, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy and Dopey all tried to put their twigs to separate those balls but all in vain. After that Doc realised that they could not classify balls by one straight line, but they can use two or more lines to separate it! And they just need to combine all the trail that they had tried. Finally, they separate blue and red balls perfectly and saved Snow White.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, boring adult, call the former six dwarfs as \"weak learner\", the twigs as \"classifier\" and Doc as \"ensemble model\". This is how I explain AdaBoost to my five years old niece.\n"

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

But, think back that I chose \"capital-gain\" in the first place, why didn't I chose \"capital-loss\". It doesn't make sense. Therefore, let me recall \"capital-loss\" as one of our important factors. On the other hand, I mischose the \"occupation\", but I have no idea why it is not one of the candidates."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

In other words, we only use \\frac{1}{20} data and receive a comparable result. This would be good news for industries because the amount of data in the real world is ridiculously massive. For example, I worked for a semiconductor foundry, we often have to use over 3000 CPUs to fit an optical model and takes me hours. Can you imagine 3000 high-performance Intel CPUs and hours to days for fitting one model? Therefore, reduce runtime is a big goal in my industry. I believe saving CPU time is important in other industries, such as medical and hospital. You could rescue more patients if the computation time is fast enough to support doctors to make right decision.\n"
